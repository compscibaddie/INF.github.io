        <section id="recommendations">
            <h3>what do we recommend</h3>
            <p6>One of the things that we can recommend is that one should ensure that they gather substantial research about data 
                laws in the regions that you would like your business to operate as different region require you to abide by different
                conditions and regulation depending on what is stipulated in their data protection laws. this is highly recommended
                as failure to comply could be detrimental to the business as well as the business owner.
